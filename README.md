# Agile Burn-up Chart

A Release is what the name implies: a set of Product Increments that is released to the customer.

Some characteristics of a release are:

*  Releases are defined by date, theme, and planned feature set. Release dates can be linked to events, like conferences or changes in the legal system
* Scope, not date or quality, is the variable, which highlights the need to use a prioritised product backlog as the basis of a planning event. When a Release date is carved in stone, and an increase in budget is unlikely and usually has no positive effect on a Release, the scope is the only variable that can make or break the release date
* If more than one team is involved, all teams must commit to the same rhythm of iterations. When all teams work to the same rhythm the discovery and management of dependencies occurs automatically during the planning activities
* A Release is typically composed by 4 - 8 Iterations

# Release Burn-Up Chart
In order to monitor the progress toward the desired goal, a good leading indicator is a Burn-Up Chart, that plots the amount of work performed, in each Iteration, against the work forecasted for the Release.
##Preparation
In order to plot the chart, the following data items must be prepared:

 * High Level estimation of work to be performed during the Release, in ranged Story Points (i.e. the pair of minimum and maximum estimation)
  *if a single estimation is available for some PBI (Product Backlog Item), then it should considered as Minimum == Maximum
* Forecasted Velocity, deduced from past performances
  * The forecast can be defined using the Yesterday's Weather pattern (average of last 3 iterations), using some statistical techniques, like Mike Cohn's Velocity Range Calculator or with a team's decision
